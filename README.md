# mi-email-worker

mi-email-worker is a bareâ€‘metal PHP 7.4 project that provides a small email queue worker using AWS SES. Messages are queued in Redis, sent respecting SES quotas and bounces/complaints are handled via Amazon SNS. Logs and suppressions are stored in PostgreSQL.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+
- Composer
- Redis
- PostgreSQL
- AWS account with SES and SNS

## Installation

1. Clone this repository and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   composer install --ignore-platform-reqs --no-interaction
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file at the project root with these variables:
   ```dotenv
   AWS_KEY=your-key
   AWS_SECRET=your-secret
   AWS_REGION=us-east-1
   REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
   REDIS_PORT=6379
   QUEUE_NAME=email_queue
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=email_worker
   DB_USER=user
   DB_PASS=pass
   ```
3. Initialize the database tables:
   ```bash
   psql -h $DB_HOST -U $DB_USER -d $DB_NAME -f scripts/init_db.sql
   ```

## Queueing Emails

Use `scripts/enqueue.php` to add an email job:
```bash
php scripts/enqueue.php --to=user@example.com --subject="Hello" --body="Test"
```

You can also integrate the static facade `SisProing\Helper\Mail` in another project to enqueue messages programmatically:
```php
use SisProing\Helper\Mail;

Mail::enqueue('user@example.com', 'Subject', 'Body');
```
Make sure the `.env` file is present so the queue configuration can be loaded.

## Running the Worker

The worker consumes the queue, applies rate limits and logs results. Run it manually:
```bash
php scripts/worker-runner.php
```

A Supervisor configuration is provided in `supervisor/email-worker.conf` to keep the worker running in production.

## Handling Bounces and Complaints

Configure an SNS topic for SES notifications and point its HTTPS subscription to `public/sns-handler.php`. This endpoint confirms the subscription and inserts bounced/complaining addresses into the `email_suppressions` table.

## Tests

To run the unit tests:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration tests/phpunit.xml.dist
```

## Using in Other Projects

Add this project as a dependency (or copy the `src/` directory) and include the `SisProing\Helper\Mail` facade in your application. Call `Mail::enqueue()` to queue emails; ensure Redis, PostgreSQL and the `.env` configuration are accessible. The worker and SNS handler can run separately from your application, providing background email processing.
